# Open a file handle piped to the "less" program; any lines written to
# this file handle will be easily scrollable on screen. The user can
# simply press Ctrl+C or Q to exit the scrollable mode.
#
# To ensure the file handle (and the associated "less" process) are
# closed at the end of the caller's scope, the caller should assign
# the returned file handle to a local variable, as in:
#
# sub example_e_g_show_help() {
#   local $helpfd = open_scrollable_stream();
#   print($helpfd, ...):
#   ...
#   (at end of $helpfd's scope, it will automatically be closed)
# }
#
# Without this, you always need to manually run close($fd) at the end.
